[System] Equipments provide no other benefits other than looking good. Everything is reliant on stats.

[System] Lets first introduce you to combat mechanics. Every monster has HP, damage, and distance.

Their HP determines how much damage they can take, and their damage dealt is rolled randomly each turn between .5x and 1.5x the player's level.

Their distance determines how far away they are from you, but the monster will not move themselves, though they are still able to attack you. The max distance is 3.

*if playerclass = "Warrior"
  Since you're a Warrior, you can only attack them when the distance is 1.
*if playerclass = "Ranger"
  Since you're a Ranger, you can attack them when the distance is 2 or 1.
*if playerclass = "Mage"
  Since you're a Mage, you can attack them when the distance is 3.

[System] To help the player adapt to this game, we have prepared a battle!

DAMN THAT SYSTEM!

Out of nowhere, a Zombie spawned at a distance.

[System] We have set the Zombie HP to 200, their damage to 0, and distance at 2.

[System] Please defeat the monster to continue :)
